# **bTools - Import Presets**  

ImportPresets allows you to automatically apply Unity's [Presets](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Presets.html) on newly imported assets, based on path and filename filters.  
It allows you to automatically set all textures in the `Assets\Textures\UI` folder to be imported as sprites, or models in any `Props` folder to be setup with rig and animations disabled for example.  
It works using Unity's Presets, and thus can be setup to automate the import settings of any asset type supported by Presets.
